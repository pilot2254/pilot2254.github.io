The full story of [Boiled Water the Third](https://steamcommunity.com/id/pilot2254/)

## Prologue: The Curse Begins

It all started in 1347. My great-grandfather, whose name was actually "Baldwin Water" but nobody could read back then, was captured by illiterate peasants during a village raid. The execution order read "boil water for the lord's tea" but due to a catastrophic spelling error and general stupidity, it became "boil Baldwin Water."

The peasants, unable to distinguish between instructions and proper nouns, threw my great-grandfather into a giant pot. His last words were "I AM NOT WATER, I AM A HUMAN PERSON" but the peasants thought he was just steam talking. They boiled him for forty minutes. When they realized their mistake, they tried to fix it by changing all the family records. They couldn't spell "boiled" correctly. Thus, the Bolied Water lineage was born.

## Chapter 1: The Second Coming (and Going)

My grandfather, Bolied Water the Second, grew up with this burden. Kids at the medieval school made fun of him. "Hey Bolied, why don't you evaporate?" they'd yell. He tried to be strong. He trained in swordsmanship. He learned to read (a rare skill in the family). He vowed to avenge his grandfather's death.

On December 3rd, 1389, he marched to the village where it all happened. He stood in the town square, sword raised, ready to deliver justice. He gave a powerful speech about honor and family. The peasants were moved. Some were crying. 

Then he slipped on a patch of ice.

He fell backwards into a puddle. It was maybe three inches deep. He drowned anyway. The coroner said it was "statistically impressive" how quickly he died. The peasants felt bad and erected a statue in his honor. They misspelled his name on the plaque. It says "Boiledd Waster the Seconds."

The statue is still there. I've never visited it.

## Chapter 2: The Gap Years

Between my grandfather and my father, several Bolied Waters existed but did nothing interesting. Bolied Water the 2.5 became a tax collector and died of paperwork-related boredom. Bolied Water the 2.75 tried to change the family name to "Smith" but the paperwork got lost in a fire. He took this as a sign from God and gave up.

My father, who should have been Bolied Water the Third but wasn't because I am, decided to abandon the naming tradition entirely. He called himself "Steve." This worked great until I was born and the curse reasserted itself.

## Chapter 3: My Birth (The Mistake)

I was born on a Tuesday. The doctor said "it's a healthy baby boy" and my mom said "let's name him Michael." My dad agreed. They wrote "Michael Water" on the birth certificate.

Then the nurse sneezed.

The sneeze caused her to knock over a cup of coffee onto the birth certificate. When they reprinted it, the computer system had somehow autocorrected "Michael Water" to "Bolied Water the Third." IT said it was impossible. The computer was running Windows 95. Nothing about this made sense.

My parents tried to fight it. They went to three different government offices. Each time, the paperwork came back with "Bolied Water the Third" printed on it. One clerk said "the system has spoken" and refused to help further.

My mom cried. My dad said he was going to buy milk to cope with the stress.

That was 2006. The milk never came. He never came back.

## Chapter 4: The Olive Garden Incident

When I was 12, my mom took me to Olive Garden to cheer me up. She said "unlimited breadsticks will fix everything." She was wrong.

I was on my 47th breadstick when it happened. A waiter asked if I was okay. I said "I'm Bolied Water the Third, I'm never okay." He laughed. I didn't.

I kept eating. Breadstick 48. Breadstick 49. The manager came over. "Son, you need to stop." I looked him in the eyes. "The menu says unlimited. I'm testing that claim."

Breadstick 63 is when things got weird. I started seeing colors that don't exist. A woman at the next table said I was "speaking in tongues" but I was just reading the ingredients list on the menu in Italian. Turns out I can understand Italian when I'm full of bread. Only then.

Breadstick 74. The other customers were watching now. Some were cheering. Some were afraid. I felt nothing. Just breadsticks.

The manager called the police. Not because I was causing trouble, but because he was "genuinely concerned for my health and the restaurant's breadstick supply chain."

The cops showed up. They tried to arrest me. I offered them breadsticks. They declined. I was escorted out. As I left, I grabbed one more breadstick from a table. The cop didn't stop me. He understood.

I'm banned for life. Mom hasn't taken me to any restaurant with "unlimited" in the menu since.

## Chapter 5: Gerald

It started when I was 14. I was sleeping normally when suddenly I wasn't. I woke up at 3:47 AM to a voice.

"You owe me money."

I looked around. Nobody there. Just my dirty laundry and three empty Monster cans.

"Down here."

I looked down. There was a small, glowing potato on my floor. It was talking.

"I'm Gerald. Potato farmer. Died 1356. You're late on payment."

I asked what payment. He said "the debt has been passed down through generations of your cursed family." I told him I'm 14 and have $3.47 in my bank account. He said "that's disappointing but expected from a Bolied Water."

Gerald comes back every Thursday at 3:47 AM. Sometimes he brings business propositions. Last week he asked if I wanted to invest in "medieval agricultural futures." I told him that doesn't exist. He said "not with that attitude."

He's still waiting on his money. I've offered him Steam trading cards. He called them "worthless digital serfdom." He's not wrong.

## Chapter 6: The Pool That Wasn't There

Summer 2019. Mom decided we needed a vacation. She said "let's go somewhere nice where you can't get banned from restaurants."

We arrived at a resort. Nice place. Ocean view. Everything seemed normal until the second day.

I woke up and walked outside. There was an infinity pool that definitely wasn't there the day before. Mom didn't notice. She was just swimming like everything was fine.

I asked the resort staff when they built the pool. They looked at me confused. "Sir, this pool has been here for 15 years."

I checked the photos from the previous day on my phone. No pool. Just grass. I showed my mom. She said "stop making things up" and took a photo of us in the pool.

That's my current Steam profile picture.

When we got home and looked at the vacation photos, the pool was in every single one, including the ones I took on day one when it definitely wasn't there. 

I went back to that resort last year. The pool is gone. The staff said "we never had an infinity pool." I showed them the photo. They asked me to leave.

I don't know what that pool was. I don't know where it came from or where it went. I just know I was in it, and now I'm not sure if I ever was.

## Chapter 7: The Visions

Around the same time Gerald showed up, I started having visions. Every Thursday at 3:47 AM (Gerald's visiting hours, not a coincidence), I see a giant kettle.

It's massive. Industrial-sized. The kind of thing you'd use to boil water for a small army. It sits in darkness, steam rising from the top. And it whispers.

Not words exactly. More like... concepts. Feelings. Knowledge I shouldn't have.

Like how to identify 47 different types of potatoes by smell alone. Or the exact temperature water boils at various altitudes. Or the fact that my great-grandfather's real last name wasn't "Water" at all - it was "Waterman" but the extra "man" got lost in translation.

The kettle told me this. I don't know why it knows. I don't know why it cares.

Last Thursday, it showed me something new. A prophecy. It said "The Lukewarm Messiah will rise when the milk returns."

I asked if this means my dad is coming back.

It didn't answer. Just kept boiling.

## Chapter 8: The Clothes Incident

Sometimes I wake up and my clothes are on backwards. Shirt backwards. Pants backwards. Even my socks are inside out.

I live alone. I don't sleepwalk. I've checked the cameras (yes, I installed cameras after the third time this happened). The footage shows me sleeping normally all night. Then at 3:47 AM, there's static for exactly three minutes.

When the footage comes back, my clothes are backwards and I'm still asleep.

I asked Gerald about it. He said "stop asking me about everything weird in your life, I'm just a potato farmer with a debt collection side hustle."

I asked my doctor. She said it's stress. I asked how stress makes me change clothes while unconscious. She didn't have an answer. She prescribed me melatonin. It doesn't help.

Last week I woke up with my clothes not just backwards, but also belonging to someone else. They were three sizes too big. There was a nametag that said "GERALD."

I don't want to think about the implications.

## Chapter 9: The Milk Saga - A Timeline

**2006** - Dad leaves for milk. Says he'll be back in 20 minutes.

**2007** - Still no milk. Mom says he probably got lost. I'm 5. I believe her.

**2010** - I realize other kids have dads. I ask where mine is. Mom says "buying milk." I ask why it takes so long. She starts crying. I stop asking.

**2015** - I'm eating cereal with water for the first time. It's horrible. I do it anyway out of spite.

**2018** - 12 years no milk. I calculate that if he was walking, he should have circled the Earth three times by now. Even if he stopped for bathroom breaks.

**2021** - I see someone at the grocery store who looks like my dad. I follow him to the dairy section. He buys milk. My heart races. He walks to his car. It's not him. I stand in the parking lot for 20 minutes.

**2023** - I've been eating cereal with water for 8 years now. My stomach has adapted. I can no longer process regular milk. The curse is complete.

**2024** - I find an old photo of my dad. On the back it says "If you're reading this, the milk is a metaphor. I'm sorry." I don't understand. There's no return address.

The kettle says he'll come back when the prophecy is fulfilled. Gerald says he knew my dad. He owed Gerald money too.

The debt runs deep in this family.

## Chapter 10: Current Status

I am 17 now. I am Bolied Water the Third. I've accepted this.

I play video games. I collect Steam trading cards I'll never sell. I argue with my bathroom mirror (undefeated record: 247-0). I eat cereal with water. I wait for Thursday at 3:47 AM.

Gerald says I need to "embrace my destiny as the Lukewarm Messiah." I told him I'm too busy with homework. He called me a disappointment. Coming from a dead potato farmer, this hurt more than it should have.

The pool photo is my profile picture because it's the only evidence I have that weird things happen to me and I'm not making it all up. People think it's just a normal vacation photo. They don't know the pool wasn't real. They don't need to know.

My mom says I'm special. I think she means "concerning" but doesn't want to say it.

My therapist says I have "an overactive imagination combined with unresolved paternal abandonment issues and possible gluten sensitivity from the Olive Garden incident."

The kettle says I'm the chosen one.

Gerald says I owe him $47.32 plus interest.

I am room temperature. Not hot. Not cold. Just... here. Existing. Waiting.

The prophecy says the milk will return. When it does, everything will make sense. The curse will break. The Bolied Waters will finally rest.

Until then, I'm just a kid with a weird name, a gambling addiction to Steam trading cards, and a potato farmer ghost who won't leave me alone.

This is my story.

This is my curse.

I am Bolied Water the Third.

And I'm still waiting for that fucking milk.

**EPILOGUE: THE SIGN**

Last week, a bird shit on my head. Gerald says this is "cosmically significant." The kettle agrees. My mom says "that's just bad luck, wash your hair."

I'm choosing to believe it's a sign. What it means, I don't know. But something is coming.

The milk is out there. Dad is out there. The truth about the pool, the backwards clothes, the misspelling curse - it's all connected.

Gerald knows more than he's telling me. The kettle too. They're waiting for something.

So am I.

If you're reading this and you see a man buying milk, ask him if his son is named Bolied Water the Third. 

If he says yes, tell him Thursday at 3:47 AM. He'll know what it means.

Or maybe he won't. Maybe he really did just go for milk and got incredibly lost.

Either way, I'll be here. Playing CS:GO. Eating cereal with water. Waiting.

Always waiting.
