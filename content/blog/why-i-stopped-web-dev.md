I've been doing web development since 2020. That's 4 years of React, Next.js, Tailwind, and all that shit. At the start of 2025, I stopped. Completely. And let me explain why:

## The NPC Problem

Web development is flooded. And I mean *flooded*. Every day there's another batch of people following tutorials, copying templates, and calling themselves developers. Don't get me wrong - I was one of them at some point. But the difference is I actually learned. Most of these people? They're just NPCs chasing trends.

Same thing happened with ethical hacking and networking. I was learning both. Got pretty decent at it. Then I looked around and realized everyone and their mom was taking the same cybersecurity bootcamp, watching the same YouTube channels, and getting the same certifications. 

The writing's on the wall. In a few years, finding a job in web dev or cybersecurity is going to be impossible. Not because you're bad - but because there's thousands of other people with the same skills, same portfolio, same everything.

## Why Game Development is Different

Game dev has people learning it too. But it's nowhere near the web dev apocalypse. 

Here's the thing: game development is hard. Really hard. You need math, physics, 3D graphics, performance optimization, and actual problem-solving skills. You can't just prompt ChatGPT to build you a game or game engine. Well, you can try, but good luck with that.

Web dev? Most of it is going to be automated soon. AI can already spit out a decent landing page. It can't make a game that doesn't suck. And fun fact: this website was completely generated with AI too.

## Reverse Engineering & Game Cheats

This is where it gets interesting.

I recently got into reverse engineering and game cheats. And holy shit, this is what I should've been doing from the start. 

First: AI won't help you here. No matter how much you beg ChatGPT, Claude, Venice or any other AI to help you bypass anti-cheat, it's going to refuse, saying that it's "unethical." Which means you actually have to learn this stuff.

Second: Not everyone can understand it. Assembly, memory manipulation, hooking, pattern scanning - this isn't something you learn in a weekend bootcamp. It takes time. It filters out the NPCs.

Third: Money. Game cheats are a massive market. People pay *good* money for working cheats. And since it's hard and most people can't do it, you're not competing with thousands of people.

But honestly? It's not even about the money. The feeling when you crack something difficult, when you reverse engineer a protection system, when your cheat finally works - that feeling is fucking incredible. Way better than "I made another CRUD app with Next.js."

## The Real Reason

Look, I'm still a beginner at this. Reverse engineering is brutal. There are days where I'm stuck on one problem for hours. But that's the point.

I don't want to do something that anyone with internet access can learn in 3 months. I don't want to compete with people who use AI to do their work. I want to do something that requires actual skill, actual learning, actual dedication.

Web dev was fine while it lasted. But I'm done being replaceable.

If you're thinking about what to learn next, ask yourself: Can an AI do this? Can an NPC learn this in a bootcamp? If the answer is yes to both, maybe pick something else.

**TLDR:** Web dev is oversaturated. Game dev isn't (yet). Reverse engineering and game cheats are hard enough that NPCs and AI can't touch it. Do something that requires a brain.
