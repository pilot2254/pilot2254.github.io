It's almost 2026. Five days left until we close out another year, and honestly, I need to talk about where I'm at - both personally and with RedFox Studios.

If you've been following RFS or you're part of the community, you've probably noticed things have been... quiet. Too quiet. And I owe you all an explanation and an apology.

## A Quick History Lesson

For those who don't know the full story, RedFox started back in 2022 as Team RedFox - just an esport team for Valorant and CS2. The name? It came to me in the shower one day back when I was a kid in 2022 (yeah, I know, peak brainstorming location). I'd always wanted my own esport team, and for some reason "RedFox" just clicked.

In 2023, we evolved into RFDP (RedFox Development Project) - a community of developers working on stuff together. Then in 2024, RedFox Studios was born. We kept the community aspect but decided to turn it into an actual company making websites, games, and apps for clients and ourselves.

Team RedFox still exists alongside RedFox Studios, but RFDP and other old projects got discontinued when RFS launched. The good news? Those old projects are now open-sourced [here](https://github.com/redfox-studios/redfox-studios-old/tree/main/projects/p) if anyone wants to check them out.

And here's something important - in the near future, we're stopping web development services. I've talked about this before in [another post](/blog/why-i-stopped-with-web-development), but yeah, I'm done with web dev. I'll finish the RFS and Team RedFox websites, and then we're moving on.

## The Apology

Let me be real with you - RedFox Studios is slowly fading into darkness, and it's mostly my fault.

I know a lot of you think RFS is forgotten. And honestly? I get why. We haven't been working on projects. There are no events on our Discord servers, no updates, no announcements, no giveaways. It's just... dead. And our website? I've been saying I'll rework it for a year straight now. A whole year. And I still haven't done shit.

The website has been down, and I keep promising it'll be back "soon." But here we are.

Here's the truth - I have a *lot* of work. School, personal projects, game jams, reverse engineering stuff I'm learning, my portfolio. And I've been trying to handle RedFox Studios basically by myself because no one else around me is really helping (and yeah, they know who they are - I'm not calling anyone out personally, but it is what it is).

But that's not an excuse. I could've done more. I *should've* done more. Instead of spending so much time playing Valorant and CS2, I could've actually pushed RFS forward. My lazy ass just didn't prioritize it, and that's on me.

So I'm sorry. To the community, to the team members who joined for fun (my classmates), to potential clients who believed in what we were building, and honestly, to myself. I let this slip, and I hate that.

Fun fact: the only client I had was [my friend](https://github.com/l3f1sh3) and he wanted my services because he wanted to support me and also have fun with the things I built.

## What's Happening in 2026?

I'm not giving up on RedFox Studios. I can't promise it'll be perfect, and I can't guarantee I won't burn out trying to balance everything, but fuck it - I'm going to try.

Here's the plan:

**Finish the damn websites.** RedFox Studios and Team RedFox sites are getting done. No more excuses. Once those are wrapped up, I'm officially stepping away from web development for clients.

**Game jams.** We're going to participate in game jams and actually create some games. That's where my passion is now anyway - game dev, not building landing pages for businesses.

**Better balance.** I need to figure out how to juggle school, my personal projects, RedFox, and having an actual life without completely destroying myself. Will I burn out? Probably. But who cares, right? I'll deal with it.

**More transparency.** If something's not working, I'll say it. If I'm falling behind, I'll be honest about it instead of ghosting the community for months.

For me personally in 2026? I want to work on myself. Get better in school. Improve my hobbies. Stop being so lazy. Right now I feel like I'm just destroying myself with laziness, and by the end of 2026, I want to be in a better place than I am now.

## The Reality Check

Look, I know the risks here. Trying to balance education, game jams, personal life, and running a company solo is a recipe for burnout. But at the same time, I'm not ready to let RFS die. I started this thing because I believed in it, and I still do.

I want to see RedFox Studios become a successful company one day. Not just a Discord server that's collecting dust. An actual studio that makes cool shit and builds a real community around it.

Will 2026 be the year that happens? I don't know. But it's a restart. A chance to actually follow through on what I've been promising.

## One More Thing

If you've stuck with RFS through all this silence, thank you. Seriously. I know I've been flaky and I've let people down, but I appreciate anyone who's still here.

Feedback is always welcome. If you have thoughts, ideas, or just want to chat about business-related stuff, hit me up on Discord: **@michal.flaska**

Let's see what 2026 brings. I'm not making any wild promises this time, but I'm going to try my best to make RedFox Studios something we can all be proud of.

Lets' not fuck it up this time.
