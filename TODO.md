## things i would like to add for blog posts:

* callouts/alerts (like GitHub's `> [!NOTE]` syntax)
* latex math support
* collapsible sections (shadcn's [accordion](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) if possible)

### things im still rethinking:

* syntax highlighting
* task list ([ ] & [x])
* mermaid diagram support
