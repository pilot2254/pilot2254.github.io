Notes:
- this is not an e-commerce. The store is just a showcase that will do things based on where you click to purchase:
  - if you decide to purchase Services, it will redirect you to my kofi page
  - if you decide to purchase products, it will show a popup (shadcn: alert dialog) telling you to contact me via discord (@michal.flaska)
  - the product and service cards will be a carousel
