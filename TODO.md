## things i would like to add for blog posts:

- [x] latex math support

### things im still rethinking:

- [ ] syntax highlighting
- [ ] task list ([ ] & [x])
- [ ] mermaid diagram support
- [ ] collapsible sections (shadcn's [accordion](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) if possible)
- [ ] callouts/alerts (like GitHub's `> [!NOTE]` syntax)
